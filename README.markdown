Neil's dotfiles
===============

The files in this repository configure a Desktop Ubuntu 20.04 system to Neil's
taste.

This repository is meant to be cloned into its own directory. It can be cloned
anywhere but I put it in `~/src/dotfiles`. Once cloned, run `install.sh` to
symlink the files into place.
