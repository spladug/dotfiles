Installation
------------

This repository is meant to be cloned into its own directory. It can be cloned
anywhere but I put it in ~/src/dotfiles.

There are two stages of install. The "install-configs" script will do a minimal
unprivileged install.  The "install-gui" script will configure a customized
desktop environment and requires root privileges to do so. The latter script
assumes and requires a debian-like system.
